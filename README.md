# RecipeFinder

https://recipefinder-cwru.herokuapp.com/allergies

### Description	
Our team created an app that finds recipes given an ingredient and filtered by cuisine, allergies, and diets.  It further allows users to create a personal profile to which they may save recipes they either find or recipes they create in their own recipe blog.

### Motivation (what problems it solves)	
Users will choose to use our app because they know they want to create a meal using a particular ingredient; users who have cultural or health considerations-- such as adherence to cultural diets or health protocols-- will be highly motivated to take advantage of the app’s search filter.  Additionally, users will be motivated to frequently visit their profile to retrieve the recipes they have found using the search bar or created using the recipe blog.

### Result		
Our team used passport NPM to allow users to register with a unique username and to log in/out of their profiles.  We also used Yummly API to autocomplete users’ ingredient searches, display results (name and image), and display nutrition facts.  Finally, we used NPMs to store users’ profile data into a MySQL database.
